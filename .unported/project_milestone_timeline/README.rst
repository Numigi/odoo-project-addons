Project Milestone Timeline
==========================

This module adds a ``Timeline View`` to Project Milestones.


.. contents:: Table of Contents

Context
-------
This module is base on the OCA module `web_timeline <https://github.com/OCA/web/tree/12.0/web_timeline>`__

The module `project_milestone_start_date <https://github.com/Numigi/odoo-project-addons/tree/12.0/project_milestone_start_date>`_
allows to define a ``Start Date`` for a Project Milestone.

Overview
--------
As a member of the group ``Projects/ Manager``, I go to Project > Configuration  > All Milestones.

I see that a ``Timeline View`` of the milestones is available.

* When I select this view, I see that the milestones are grouped by project and that they are displayed on the timeline according to the ``Start Date`` and ``End Date`` of the milestone.

* When I click on one of the milestones in the Timeline View, I can move it by ``Drag & Drop``.
  
  ** This action updates the ``Start Date`` and ``End Date`` on the milestone.

* When I double click on the milestone from the Timeline View, the milestone Form View opens in ``edit`` mode.

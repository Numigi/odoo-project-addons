Project Task Analytic Lines (Stock Binding)
===========================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Summary
-------
This module is a binding between project_task_analytic_lines and the inventory application.

Real Time Inventory
-------------------
When using a real time inventory, journal items are added with the customer invoice
to recognize the cost of goods sold.

The task is propagated to these entries.

Note For Purchases
------------------
The real time inventory journal items generated by a supplier invoice should logically
never be bound to a task.

The reason is that journal entries for incomming stocks should not have an analytic account,
because these are not expenses.

This note is True if you are using `Accrual Based Accounting` (what Odoo calls anglo-saxon accounting),
which is the right accounting method for most compangies.

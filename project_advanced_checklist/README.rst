Usage
-----
As a project manager, I carry out checklists,

I create a new checklist that contains the following fields:
-Name
-Description
-Items

.. image:: static/description/checklist_form_view.png

On the task, a new field `Checklist` is available.
By defining a checklist, a new tab is displayed, where the elements which constitute 
the checklist are displayed accompanied by a progress bar.

On the Kanban task view, the progress bar is displayed for tasks for which a checklist is defined.

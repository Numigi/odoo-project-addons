Project Time Budget
===================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Context
-------
The module project_time_range adds ranges of time (Min / Ideal / Max) on projects and tasks.

The module project_template allows to create tasks from templates.

Overview
--------
This module uses the concept of a template task in the context of a budgeted project.

The template tasks under a project represent the initial estimations of the project.

The actual tasks represent the ongoing estimation of the project.

Usage
-----
In the form view of my project, I click the ``Templates`` button.

In the form view of the project, In the ``Management`` tab, I notice a new section ``Budget``.

This section contains the sum of hours of template tasks under the project.

The ``Remaining`` field is computed based on the time ``Spent`` and the ``Budgeted Ideal``.

The fields ``Budgeted Min / Ideal / Max`` are also added to the list view of projects.

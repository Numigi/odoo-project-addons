Project WIP Material
====================
This module is a binding between ``project_wip`` (Project Work in Progress) and ``project_material`` (Material Consumption on Projects)

After consuming the products, the cost is accruded in the WIP account of the project.

Usage
-----
In the general ledger, I filter the journal items to see only items related to my project:

I notice that 2 debit entries were posted in the ``Work in Progress`` account, one for each product consumed.

In the analytic lines list, I also find 2 entries for the consumed products.

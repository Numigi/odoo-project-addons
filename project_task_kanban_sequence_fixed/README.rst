Project Task Kanban Sequence Fixed
==================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Context
-------
The module ``project_task_kanban_sequence_fixed`` will block the drag and drop on the ``stage`` column in kanban view of project task.

This is to prevent all user to accidentally change the sequence of stage.

Usage
-----
Make sure that project is installed. So I have the main project menu.

After that, I go to project then click on one record. It will show a list of task linked to this project in a kanban view.

In the kanban view, the user could not drag and drop column anymore.

Project WIP Timesheet
=====================
This module extends the project_wip (Project Work in Progress) module.

It allows to automatically generate WIP journal entries from timesheet entries.

Configuration
-------------
As member of the group `Project / Manager`, I go to the form view of a project type.

I notice 2 new fields:

* Salary Account
* Salary Journal

These 2 fields allow to define the salary account and journal to use in WIP journal entries generated from timesheets.

If these fields are not filled, no salary entry will be generated by the timesheets for this project type.

Usage
-----
As member of the group `Project / User`, I go to the form view of a task.

I add a timesheet line.

As member of the group `Accounting / Billing`, I go to the general ledger and filter to see only entries for my project.

I see one entry for my timesheet line.

I go to the list of analytic lines and I filter to see only entries for my project.

Updating A Timesheet Line
-------------------------
When modifying an existing timesheet line, the journal entry is updated (if required).

For example, I modify the date on my timesheet line:

.. image:: static/description/timesheet_line_updated.png

The date is propagated to the journal entry:

Deleting A Timesheet Line
-------------------------
When deleting a timesheet line, the journal entry is reversed.

WIP Entries Transfered To CGS
-----------------------------
If a `WIP / Salary` journal entry is already transfered to CGS (cost of goods sold),
the timesheet line can not be updated or deleted.

If a user attempts to update such timesheet line, the following blocking message will appear:

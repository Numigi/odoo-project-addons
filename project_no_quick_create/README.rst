Project No Quick Create
=======================
This module prevents the quick create of a project.

.. contents:: Table of contents

Context
-------
In vanilla Odoo, it is possible to create a project directly from the kanban view.

It is done in a simplified version of the form view of a project.

This leads to projects missing very important fields (such as an analytic account).

Usage
-----
When this module is installed, when creating a project from the kanban view,
the complete form view is opened.

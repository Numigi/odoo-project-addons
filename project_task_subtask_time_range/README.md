# Project Task Subtask Time Range

Add three computed fields that display the sum of the planned hours, the min hours and the max hours on the
parent task view.

It helps to compare what was inform as planned, min and max on the parent task compared to what is really in subtasks.

By design, the new fields are displayed only if the task has subtask.

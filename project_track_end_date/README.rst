Project Track Expiration Date
=============================
This module gives the possibility to trace the changes in the end of validity date of each project.

Usage
-----
*UPDATE OF EXPIRATION DATE*
Changing the expiry date must be done by clicking on the `Edit Expiration Date` button:

The `Expiration Date` is now readonly and can only be modified using the new button.

A popup wizard will open :

This modification is listed among others in the following list.
The list is accessible from the smart button:

*EXPECTED DURATION OF A PROJECT*
I can also see that under the `Expiration Date` of project, in a view form, there is a new field `Expected Duration (in Weeks)`.
This field is calculated and updated each time the expiration date is revised, this makes it easy to use the number of weeks on the project.

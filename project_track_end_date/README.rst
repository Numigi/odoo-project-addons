Project Track End Date
======================
This module gives the possibility to trace the changes in the end of validity date of each project/milestone.

Usage
-----
Changing the expiry date must be done by clicking on the `Edit End Date` button:

The `Expiration Date` field must be locked and is only modified using the modification button. Manual modification will not be possible.

A popup wizard will open :

This modification is listed among others in the following list.
The list is accessible from the smart button:

Also, I can see that under the `Expiration Date` of project, in a view form, there is a new field `Expected week duration`.
This field is calculated and updated each time the end date is revised, this makes it easy to use the number of weeks on the project.

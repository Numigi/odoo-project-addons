# Project Form With Dates

This module adds the fields `Start Date` and `Expiration Date` to the form view of a project.

![Project Form](static/description/project_form.png?raw=true)

The 2 fields exist in the code of the community version of Odoo, but are not present in the form view of projects.
They are added to the form view by the enterprise module `project_forecast`.
This module allows using the fields without installing `project_forecast`.

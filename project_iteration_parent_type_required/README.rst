Project Iteration Parent Type Required
======================================

This modules allows to drive the require of parent in project from the project type.

by checking the boolean Is Parent Required, all the project of this type must have a parent set.

when I go to the project types, I see a new checkbox

After having set up the types, I can see the effect on project

If the type requires a parent project

Otherwise

========================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Description
-----------

* The module allows to re-imput the subcontracting times automatically, or not to do so, depending on the article, task status, purchase status and vendor.
* The module adds **Subcontracting** section in product form view and **Subcontracting - Automate Time Entries** checkbox.
* The module adds 2 fields in vendor form view, Purchase section:

    - Subcontracting - Automate Time Entries (checkbox).
    - Employee for Time Entries (required if first field is checked).
  This employee is used to create the timesheet.
* The module adds new field in task status (**Create Subcontractors Time Entries**).
* When the task passes to a status in which the box **Create Subcontractors Time Entries** is checked, the system verifies following conditions to create time entries automatically:

  - The subcontracting PO is in `Purchase Order` or `Done` status.
  - The PO Vendor has the box **Subcontracting - Automate Time Entries** checked
  - The article selected in the PO has the box **Subcontracting - Automate Time Entries** checked.
  - The PO line has not already generated an automated time entry for this task.

Create a second PO from the same task with previously created vendor and product. Then confirm the order.
Since the task is already in a status with `create subcontracting time entries` checked, a new timesheet will be created automatically from the PO.

A note is added to the PO logs to inform that a time entry has been created automatically for the PO.

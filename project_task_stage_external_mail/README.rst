Since version 12.0, instead of publishing an email, an internal note is sent.

The main purpose of the module is to have automatic messages at the
creation of support task to be published to clients.

Usage
-----
As ``Project / Manager``, I go to the form view of a task stage.

I select an email template to be sent for this stage.
